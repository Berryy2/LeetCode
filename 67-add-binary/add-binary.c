// In our approach, we will use a carry variable to handle bit-wise addition, knowing that:
// a) 2 % 2 is 0 and then the carry / 2 = 1 is like 1 + 1 = 0 and carry 1.
// b) 1 % 2 is 1 and then the carry / 2 = 0 is like 1 + 0 = 1 and carry 0.
// c) 0 % 2 is 0 and then the carry / 2 = 0 is like 0 + 0 = 0 and carry 0.
// Lastly, we will return string + remaining size to skip any undefined (garbage) value.
// With this logic, we can process both strings from right to left and build the result.
