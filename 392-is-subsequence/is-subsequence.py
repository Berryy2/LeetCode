 Two-pointer approach:
  We check whether every character in string `s` appears in string `t` in the same order.
  1. Initialize two pointers at the start of each string.
  2. Traverse `t`. When characters at both pointers match, increment the `s` pointer.
  3. If `s` reaches its end, all its characters appeared in order â†’ return true.
  4. If traversal of `t` finishes before `s` does, return false.
